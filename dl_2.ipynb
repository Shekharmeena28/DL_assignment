    "An artificial neuron, also known as a perceptron or a single-layer neural unit, is a simplified computational model inspired by biological neurons. While it is a highly abstract representation, it shares some conceptual similarities with biological neurons. Here's an overview of the structure of an artificial neuron and its comparison to a biological neuron:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure of an Artificial Neuron:**\n",
    "An artificial neuron typically consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Layer:** The input layer receives input signals, which can be real-valued numbers. Each input is associated with a weight that represents its importance. These weights can be adjusted during the learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weights:** Weights are parameters associated with each input. They determine the strength of the connection between the input and the neuron. In machine learning, these weights are adjusted through training to learn the appropriate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Summation Function:** The inputs, each multiplied by their corresponding weights, are summed together. This summation process is often represented as a weighted sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\\text{Weighted Sum} = w_1 \\cdot x_1 + w_2 \\cdot x_2 + \\ldots + w_n \\cdot x_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, $x_i$ represents the input, and $w_i$ represents the weight associated with that input.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Activation Function:** The weighted sum is passed through an activation function, also known as a transfer function. The activation function determines whether the neuron should \"fire\" or produce an output based on the weighted sum. Common activation functions include step functions, sigmoid functions, and rectified linear units (ReLUs).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output:** The output of the activation function is the final output of the artificial neuron. It may be further used in subsequent layers of a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Similarities to a Biological Neuron:**\n",
    "While an artificial neuron is a highly simplified abstraction, it shares some conceptual similarities with biological neurons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inputs and Weights:** In both cases, information is received from multiple sources (dendrites in biological neurons and input connections in artificial neurons), and the importance of each source is weighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Summation:** Both biological neurons and artificial neurons perform a summation of the weighted inputs. In biological neurons, this occurs at the cell body (soma).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Activation:** Both types of neurons use an activation process to determine whether to generate an output. In biological neurons, this involves an electrical potential reaching a threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output:** The final result of both types of neurons is an output signal. In biological neurons, this can be an action potential or neurotransmitter release, while in artificial neurons, it's the output of the activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences:**\n",
    "It's important to note that artificial neurons are highly simplified compared to biological neurons. They do not capture the full complexity of biological neural networks, which involve intricate structures, chemical signaling, and complex patterns of connectivity. Additionally, artificial neurons are designed for mathematical and computational modeling, whereas biological neurons serve various physiological functions beyond computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, artificial neurons serve as the basic building blocks of artificial neural networks, which are used in machine learning and deep learning to model complex relationships in data. They are a mathematical abstraction inspired by the essential characteristics of biological neurons, tailored for solving computational problems."

    "Activation functions are a crucial component of artificial neural networks, responsible for introducing non-linearity into the model and enabling neural networks to approximate complex, non-linear functions. Several popular activation functions are commonly used in neural network architectures. Here are some of the most popular activation functions and explanations for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Step Function:**\n",
    "   - The step function, also known as the Heaviside step function, is one of the simplest activation functions.\n",
    "   - It takes an input and returns 1 if the input is greater than or equal to a certain threshold (usually 0), and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "   - It is primarily used in binary classification problems, where the output should be either 0 or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ![Step Function](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Dirac_distribution_CDF.svg/500px-Dirac_distribution_CDF.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sigmoid Function (Logistic Function):**\n",
    "   - The sigmoid function is a smooth, S-shaped curve that maps input values to the range (0, 1).\n",
    "   - It is useful for binary classification problems where the output represents probabilities.\n",
    "   - However, it can suffer from vanishing gradients during training in deep networks.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh) Function:**\n",
    "   - The tanh function is similar to the sigmoid but maps input values to the range (-1, 1).\n",
    "   - It is often used in hidden layers of neural networks.\n",
    "   - Like the sigmoid, it can also suffer from vanishing gradients.\n",

    "4. **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU):**\n",
    "   - ReLU is one of the most popular activation functions.\n",
    "   - It returns the input if it is positive and zero otherwise.\n",
    "   - It introduces non-linearity, is computationally efficient, and helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "   - However, it can suffer from the \"dying ReLU\" problem where neurons can become inactive during training.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. **Leaky ReLU:**\n",
    "   - Leaky ReLU is a variation of ReLU that addresses the \"dying ReLU\" problem.\n",
    "   - It allows a small, non-zero gradient when the input is negative, preventing neurons from becoming completely inactive.\n",
    "   - It is defined as follows, where $\\alpha$ is a small positive constant:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\\text{Leaky ReLU}(x) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "       x & \\text{if } x \\geq 0 \\\\\n",

    "   ![Leaky ReLU Function](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Activation_prelu.svg/500px-Activation_prelu.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Exponential Linear Unit (ELU):**\n",
    "   - ELU is another variation of ReLU that aims to address the limitations of the original ReLU.\n",
    "   - It allows negative values by smoothly transitioning into the exponential regime for negative inputs.\n",
    "   - It can help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and the dying ReLU problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\\text{ELU}(x) = \\begin{cases}\n",

    "Rosenblatt's perceptron model is one of the earliest artificial neural network architectures, introduced in the late 1950s. It serves as a fundamental building block for understanding neural networks and the concept of supervised learning. The perceptron is a simple binary classifier that can learn to separate data into two classes. Here's a detailed explanation of Rosenblatt's perceptron model and how it classifies data:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rosenblatt's Perceptron Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inputs and Weights:**\n",
    "   - The perceptron receives a set of input values, usually denoted as \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\).\n",
    "   - Each input is associated with a weight \\(w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n\\), representing the importance or strength of that input.\n",
    "   - These weights are adjustable during training and start with random or initial values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weighted Sum (Activation):**\n",
    "   - The perceptron computes a weighted sum of the inputs and weights, which is represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "     $$\\text{Weighted Sum (z)} = w_1 \\cdot x_1 + w_2 \\cdot x_2 + \\ldots + w_n \\cdot x_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Activation Function:**\n",
    "   - The weighted sum is then passed through an activation function (step function in the original perceptron model) to determine the output of the perceptron.\n",
    "   - The activation function is a threshold function:\n",
    "     - If \\(z \\geq \\text{threshold}\\), the perceptron outputs 1 (class A).\n",
    "     - If \\(z < \\text{threshold}\\), the perceptron outputs 0 (class B).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training:**\n",
    "   - During training, the perceptron learns to adjust its weights in a way that allows it to correctly classify training data.\n",
    "   - The perceptron uses a supervised learning algorithm that compares its output to the desired output (the true class label) for each input example.\n",
    "   - If the perceptron's output is correct, no weight adjustments are made.\n",
    "   - If the perceptron misclassifies an example, it updates its weights to reduce the error.\n",
    "   - One common weight update rule is the perceptron learning rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "     $$\\Delta w_i = \\text{learning rate} \\cdot ( \\text{target} - \\text{output}) \\cdot x_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "     where \\(\\Delta w_i\\) is the change in weight for input \\(x_i\\), the learning rate controls the size of weight updates, \\(\\text{target}\\) is the desired output, and \\(\\text{output}\\) is the perceptron's actual output.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Convergence:**\n",
    "   - The training process continues until the perceptron correctly classifies all training examples or a predefined number of epochs is reached.\n",
    "   - If the data is linearly separable (i.e., there exists a hyperplane that can separate the two classes), the perceptron is guaranteed to converge to a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classifying Data Using a Perceptron:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Data:**\n",
    "   - Input data is represented as feature vectors, where each feature corresponds to an input \\(x_i\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weights Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Initially, the weights \\(w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n\\) are typically initialized with small random values or zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Forward Pass (Inference):**\n",
    "   - Given an input feature vector, the perceptron computes the weighted sum of inputs and weights: \\(z = w_1 \\cdot x_1 + w_2 \\cdot x_2 + \\ldots + w_n \\cdot x_n\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Activation:**\n",
    "   - The weighted sum \\(z\\) is passed through the activation function (step function), which produces an output.\n",
    "   - If the output is 1, the input is classified into class A; if the output is 0, it's classified into class B.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Training:**\n",
    "   - During training, the perceptron updates its weights based on the error between its output and the true class label for the training data.\n",
    "   - The goal is to find weights that allow the perceptron to correctly classify the training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Testing:**\n",
    "   - Once trained, the perceptron can be used to classify new, unseen data by applying the same forward pass and activation rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the perceptron is limited to linearly separable problems and may not converge for data that cannot be separated by a single hyperplane. For more complex tasks, multi-layer perceptrons (feedforward neural networks) with non-linear activation functions are used. Rosenblatt's perceptron model laid the foundation for the development of more advanced neural network architectures and learning algorithms."

The number of hidden layers and neurons in each layer can be customized based on the complexity of the problem.\n",

    "2. **Forward Pass (Inference):**\n",
    "   - During the forward pass, input data is fed into the network, and information flows from the input layer through hidden layers to the output layer.\n",
    "   - Neurons in each layer calculate a weighted sum of their inputs and apply an activation function to produce an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prediction:** The network generates predictions based on the current weights, which may not be accurate initially.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Loss Calculation:** A loss function (also known as a cost function) measures the difference between the predicted outputs and the actual target values in the training data. Common loss functions include mean squared error (MSE) for regression and cross-entropy for classification.\n",

    "5. **Backpropagation:** Backpropagation is the core of the learning process. It involves propagating the error backward through the network to update the weights. The steps are as follows:\n",
    "   - Calculate the gradient of the loss with respect to each weight in the network using the chain rule of calculus.\n",
    "   - Update the weights in the direction that minimizes the loss, typically using an optimization algorithm like stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\n",
